### Notes
Challenges that encountered while building the app

-  One of the challenges I encountered while building the app was that there was a typo when it came to the API url in which took me an hour or so to look over the code to see where I made a mistake.
-  The second challenge I encountered was getting the right size for the image posters for the superhero cell.

The challenges I encountered while building the app were
